## 🚀 Market Timing & Structural Opportunity

Cities worldwide experience systemic financial and operational inefficiencies driven by:

- Persistent revenue leakage  
- Under-optimized infrastructure assets  
- Fragmented and siloed data systems  
- Absence of real-time, AI-driven decision intelligence
