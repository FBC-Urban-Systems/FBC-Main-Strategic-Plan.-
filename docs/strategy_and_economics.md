## 💰 Revenue Architecture

FBC monetizes cities through stacked revenue layers:

1. **City-OS Licensing** – Core operating system subscription  
2. **Urban Revenue Optimization** – AI-driven incremental yield share  
3. **Traffic Intelligence Markets** – Risk & safety data licensing  
4. **Private District SaaS** – Smart infrastructure management  
5. **Digital Earth Exchange** – Global urban data marketplace  

This multi-stream model creates compounding lifetime value per city node.
