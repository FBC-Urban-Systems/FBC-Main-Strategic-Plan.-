# Project VI
## Global Dominance & Planetary-Scale Urban Intelligence (2035–2037)

**Version:** v7.1.0-LTS-ENTERPRISE-MAX  
**Classification:** EXECUTIVE_CRITICAL  
**Project Role:** Planetary Urban Intelligence Control Layer  

---

## 1. Strategic Positioning

Project VI represents the terminal convergence layer of all FBC Digital Systems.
It transforms FBC from a portfolio of advanced urban AI products into a
**single planetary-scale intelligence infrastructure**.

At maturity, FBC operates as **persistent global urban infrastructure**
rather than a conventional technology vendor.

---

## 2. Core Mission

Establish FBC as the default intelligence layer for modern civilization by:

- Operating city-scale AI control systems at sovereign reliability levels
- Monetizing urban intelligence through regulated global data exchanges
- Delivering auditable financial, risk, and infrastructure intelligence
- Orchestrating cross-border urban optimization at planetary scale

---

## 3. System Scope (2035–2037)

Project VI integrates and governs:

- City-OS cores deployed across all active metropolitan nodes
- Embedded AI revenue engines within municipal finance systems
- Traffic, risk, and infrastructure intelligence grids
- Planetary Urban Data Exchange (Digital Earth Layer)
- Cryptographically immutable financial and data audit ledgers

The resulting system exhibits **high switching friction, compounding data value,
and irreversible network effects**.

## 4. Target Network Metrics (2037)

| Metric | Target |
|------|--------|
| Connected Cities | 80+ |
| Average ARR per City | USD 12M – 20M |
| Total Network ARR | USD 1.2B – 1.8B |
| Gross Margin | 85%+ |
| Enterprise Valuation | USD 25B – 35B+ |
| Market Position | Category-Defining Urban OS |

All targets are derived from deterministic simulation engines and
validated against the official FBC Strategic Plan.

---

## 5. Planetary Architecture Overview

The system architecture is composed of:

- Federated city nodes operating under localized compliance regimes
- Centralized intelligence coordination and optimization layers
- Secure cross-border data exchange protocols
- Continuous autonomous financial and operational audits
- AI governance, override, and explainability frameworks

This architecture enables **planetary scalability without centralization risk**.

---

## 6. Governance, Audit & Compliance

Project VI operates under infrastructure-grade governance:

- Continuous autonomous audit enforcement
- Full AI model traceability and explainability
- Jurisdiction-aware data sovereignty controls
- Enterprise SLA-level uptime and resilience guarantees

Designed to satisfy **regulatory, sovereign, institutional, and capital market requirements**.

---

## 7. Strategic Outcomes

By completion, Project VI delivers:

- Global dominance in city-scale AI infrastructure
- Structural defensibility via data and network effects
- Long-duration, infrastructure-grade cash flows
- Positioning as the intelligence backbone of urban civilization

---

## 8. Strategic Continuity

Project VI is a foundation, not a terminus.

It serves as the execution layer for **Digital Earth 3.0** and future
planetary-scale intelligence and optimization markets.
