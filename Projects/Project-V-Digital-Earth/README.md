# Project V  
## Digital Earth & Planetary-Scale Urban Data Exchange (2033–2035)

---

## 🌍 Strategic Mission

Project V establishes **Digital Earth** — the first planetary-scale real-time digital twin of urban civilization.

By aggregating live intelligence from all FBC-operated cities, Digital Earth becomes the **global marketplace for urban data, predictive modeling, and real-time economic intelligence**.

---

## 🧠 Core Vision

To transform city-generated data into a continuously monetized planetary asset — powering governments, enterprises, research institutions, and global AI systems.

---

## 📡 Global Data Streams

- Real-Time Traffic Flow Networks  
- Energy Consumption & Optimization Grids  
- Urban Economic Activity Signals  
- Environmental Impact Monitoring  
- Infrastructure Stress & Predictive Maintenance Feeds  

Each stream is secured, anonymized, and packaged via **SDEP (Secure Data Exchange Protocol)**.
