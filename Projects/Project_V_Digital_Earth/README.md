# Project V
## Digital Earth — Planetary Urban Intelligence Exchange

Version: v7.0.0-LTS  
Classification: Enterprise-Strategic / Audit-Critical  
Operational Window: 2033–2035  
Data Mode: Real-Time / Deterministic Aggregation  

---

## 1. Strategic Mission

Project V establishes **Digital Earth**, FBC’s planetary-scale
urban intelligence exchange.

Digital Earth aggregates, normalizes, and monetizes real-time intelligence
from all FBC-operated city nodes, forming a continuously updating
digital representation of urban civilization.

This layer transforms cities from isolated deployments into
a **global, compounding intelligence network**.

---

## 2. Core Strategic Role

Digital Earth functions as:

- The global aggregation layer for all City-OS deployments
- A monetizable marketplace for verified urban intelligence
- The primary feeder system for Project VI (Global Dominance)
- A defensible data-network moat built on real city operations

Digital Earth does not simulate cities.
It aggregates **live operational intelligence**.

---

## 3. Global Urban Data Streams

Digital Earth ingests and standardizes the following streams:

- Real-time traffic flow and congestion intelligence
- Energy consumption, loss, and optimization signals
- Urban economic activity indicators
- Environmental impact and emissions metrics
- Infrastructure stress, degradation, and predictive maintenance signals

All streams are:
- Anonymized at source
- Deterministically structured
- Secured via SDEP and SHA-256 integrity proofs

## 4. Monetization Architecture (Data-as-a-Service)

Digital Earth operates a tiered intelligence market:

| Product Tier | Target Clients | Contract Value (Annual) |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Sovereign Intelligence Feeds | National governments & regulators | $20M – $100M |
| Enterprise Predictive Intelligence | Global enterprises & infrastructure operators | $10M – $50M |
| Research & Institutional Access | Universities & policy institutions | $500K – $2M |
| AI Training Data Markets | Global AI model providers | Usage-based |

All data products are contractually auditable and non-reversible.

---

## 5. Network Scale Targets (By 2035)

| Metric | Target |
|------|--------|
| Connected FBC Cities | 60+ |
| Daily Active Urban Data Points | 10B+ |
| Digital Twin Coverage | Continental-level |
| Gross Margin | 85%+ |
| Target ARR | $400M – $700M |

Revenue scales non-linearly as new cities join the network.

---

## 6. Data Governance & Compliance

Digital Earth enforces:

- End-to-end SHA-256 data integrity verification
- Secure Data Exchange Protocol (SDEP)
- GDPR and national data sovereignty compliance
- Immutable audit trails for every data transaction
- Deterministic schemas for enterprise consumers

No data is exposed without cryptographic verification.

---

## 7. Strategic Outcome

By completion of Project V, FBC achieves:

- The world’s first commercial planetary-scale urban intelligence network
- A defensible data monopoly derived from real infrastructure
- High-margin recurring data revenues independent of city licensing
- A direct strategic bridge into Project VI global dominance architecture
