# FBC Digital Systems
## Phase I Financial Roadmap — Execution Summary (2027–2030)

## 1. Phase I Valuation Objective

**Target Valuation:** ~$1.2 Billion USD by end of 2030

Phase I establishes FBC’s commercial validation through
revenue-positive city deployments and a repeatable,
auditable execution architecture.

All valuation targets are execution-driven and derived
from ARR-based Infrastructure SaaS valuation multiples.

- Annual subscription per city node
- Average Contract Value (ACV): $8M – $15M per city
- Recurring, high-margin infrastructure SaaS model

### 2.2 AI Revenue Optimization — Project I
- Deterministic municipal revenue uplift: ~20–30%
- FBC revenue share: ~20% of incremental gains only
- Zero upfront capital expenditure required from cities
- CI-validated, audit-safe revenue logic

### 2.3 Private Smart District SaaS — Project II
- Initial setup fee: $1M – $3M per district
- Annual SaaS subscription: $500K – $1M
- Modular deployment independent of full City-OS rollout

### 2.4 Urban Data & Intelligence Monetization
- Traffic risk intelligence feeds
- Energy optimization and loss detection analytics
- Institutional and commercial data licensing
