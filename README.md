## 🌍 Executive Overview

**FBC Digital Systems** develops a unified **City Operating System (City-OS)** — a modular AI, data, and security platform designed to help cities optimize revenue, infrastructure, safety, and data governance.

The system integrates multiple urban intelligence engines into a single operational and financial control layer.

This repository contains **working simulation-grade implementations** of core City-OS components.

## 🧠 Core Technology Pillars

| Layer | Module | Description |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Project I** | Urban Revenue AI | Revenue optimization, yield modeling, and leakage control |
| **Project II** | Private District OS | Energy intelligence and smart district optimization |
| **Project III** | Traffic Intelligence | Real-time traffic risk and accident probability analysis |
| **Project III-Ledger** | Secure Vault | Immutable SHA-256 audit and verification layer |
| **Project IV** | City-OS Kernel | Unified API and execution gateway |
| **Project V** | Digital Earth Exchange | Framework for ethical urban data monetization |
| **Project VI** | Expansion Simulator | Long-term scaling and valuation modeling |

Each module is independently testable and designed for future production hardening.
