## Executive Overview

FBC Digital Systems develops a unified AI-driven
Urban Operating System (City-OS).

City-OS is designed to enable cities to manage,
optimize, and govern revenue, infrastructure,
public safety, and urban data through
a single, secure, and auditable platform.

This repository contains working,
simulation-grade implementations
of core City-OS components.

It represents an engineering and strategic foundation,
not a conceptual prototype.

---

## Core System Architecture

City-OS is structured as a modular,
multi-project operating system.

Each project operates independently
while integrating through a unified kernel.

| Project | Module | Function |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Project I | Urban Revenue AI | Municipal revenue optimization and leakage modeling |
| Project II | Private District OS | Energy intelligence and infrastructure efficiency |
| Project III-A | Traffic Intelligence | Traffic risk and accident probability analysis |
| Project III-B | Secure Ledger | Immutable SHA-256 audit and integrity proofs |
| Project IV | City-OS Kernel | Unified execution and API orchestration |
| Project V | Digital Earth Exchange | Governed urban data monetization framework |
| Project VI | Expansion Simulator | Long-term scaling and valuation modeling |

All modules are designed for
deterministic execution and future production hardening.

## Strategic Roadmap (2027–2037)

| Phase | Focus | Target Outcome | Status |
|------|------|----------------|--------|
| Phase I (2027–2029) | Revenue AI & Pilot Cities | Foundational deployments | Active Development |
| Phase II (2030–2033) | City-OS Expansion | Regional scaling | Simulation Validated |
| Phase III (2034–2037) | Global City Network | Planet-scale City-OS | Strategic Design |

Roadmap reflects modeled execution paths
based on infrastructure, governance,
and adoption constraints.

## Financial & Scale Indicators (Model-Level)

The following metrics represent
simulation-based strategic models:

- Target Global Nodes: 80+ cities
- Projected ARR (Phase III): USD 700M – 1.5B
- Target Gross Margin: 80%+
- LTV / CAC Ratio: 40x+

Figures are non-binding
and used exclusively for planning and simulation.

## Live System Components

This repository includes functional systems:

- Global multi-city simulation engine
- Unified API kernel
- Executive command dashboard
- PDF and data export framework
- Secure cryptographic ledger

All systems are implemented as
working prototypes, not mockups.
